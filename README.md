# Muledump CORS Adapter for Firefox

View in the [Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/muledump-cors-adapter-firefox/).

This is a fork of the [CorsEverywhere](https://github.com/spenibus/cors-everywhere-firefox-addon) Firefox add-on that has been updated to work specifically with the [Jakcodex/Muledump](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump) application.

It is configured to work immediately after installation and takes no user configuration other than the option to disable it on browser startup.
